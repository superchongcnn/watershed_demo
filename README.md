# Conclusion and Summay

| Advantages                       | Disadvantages                                | Directions for Improvement                   |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **High-precision edge detection:** Pixel-level continuous closed boundaries | **Over-segmentation problem:** Noise/texture leads to region fragmentation | More robust marker generation methods        |
| **No pre-defined target count required:** Automatic identification of extreme value regions | **Noise sensitive:** Gradient map easily interfered with | Integration of multi-modal data              |
| **Multi-scale adaptability:** Handles targets of different sizes | **High computational complexity:** Low efficiency for high-resolution images | Adaptive parameter selection                 |
| **Strong extensibility:** Easy integration with other technologies | **Reliance on initial markers:** Marker quality directly impacts results | 3D/4D data segmentation                      |
